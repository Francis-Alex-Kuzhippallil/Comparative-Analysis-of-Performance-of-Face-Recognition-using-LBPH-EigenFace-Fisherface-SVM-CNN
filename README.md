# Comparative-Analysis-of-Performance-of-Face-Recognition-using-LBPH-EigenFace-Fisherface-SVM-CNN
Face recognition is a technique that identifies or locates human faces in digital images. A typical example of face detection occurs when we take photographs through our smartphones, and it instantly detects faces in the picture. Face detection is different from Face recognition. Face detection detects merely the presence of faces in an image while facial recognition involves identifying whose face it is. Face Recognition has many applications in biometrics, surveillance systems, information security and law enforcement. The aim of this project is to implement face recognition using the Eigenface, Fisherface, SVM, CNN, LBPH algorithms and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision), a popular computer vision library. Furthermore developing a hybrid algorithm based on the fusion of the algorithms mentioned and comparing the performance of the algorithms in face recognition with accuracy as performance metrics. Lastly, hybrid algorithm is used to perform real-time detection and recognition of face, which might be used for security level applications.
